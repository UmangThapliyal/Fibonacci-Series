# Fibonacci-Series
Django Program to Calculate the Nth number of Fibonacci Series

Fibonacci is a Django application that displays the Nth number in Fibonacci sequence. 
For instance, if N is 6 and the sequence starts with [1,1..] then it displays ‘8’ as the 6th element in the sequence. 
It also prints the time it took to get the results back to the user.
